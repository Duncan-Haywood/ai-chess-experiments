# AI Chess Experiments

This project explores various AI approaches to play chess on Lichess. The goal is to experiment with different AI techniques and strategies for playing chess through the Lichess API.

## Project Structure

- `ai_chess_experiments/`
  - `engines/` - Different AI engine implementations
  - `models/` - ML models and training code
  - `utils/` - Utility functions for Lichess interaction and chess operations

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your Lichess API token:
   ```
   LICHESS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

## Usage

(Documentation will be added as different AI approaches are implemented)

## Planned Experiments

- Rule-based engines
- Machine Learning approaches
  - Deep Learning models
  - Reinforcement Learning
- Hybrid approaches
